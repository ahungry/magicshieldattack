* TODO Multiple levels
Add a hole that will drop players to a lower level (new world map
query), as well as an item to take them up a level (a rope or portal
or something).
* TODO Visible on-ground items
Probably a new endpoint call to query + display all grabbable items on
the ground.
* DONE Clean up the UI
Particularly for mobile, need a button to flip between move/m/s/a
* TODO Add music / sounds when events occur
Self explanatory
* TODO Need to fix bug with saving data to edn file (it did not persist for some reason)
Probably a better option would just be to add a sqlite layer for
persisting the game, that way writes (such as a single bad one) can't
end up botching the entire game state.
* TODO When mob dies, despawn it next refresh
* TODO Ensure that we stop showing mob on map when they aren't in our zone
