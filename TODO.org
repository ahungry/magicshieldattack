* TODO Multiple levels
Add a hole that will drop players to a lower level (new world map
query), as well as an item to take them up a level (a rope or portal
or something).
* TODO Visible on-ground items
Probably a new endpoint call to query + display all grabbable items on
the ground.
* TODO Clean up the UI
Particularly for mobile, need a button to flip between move/m/s/a
* TODO Add music / sounds when events occur
Self explanatory
