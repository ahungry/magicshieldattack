* Export/client notes
Godot 3 does not support GLES 2, only 3, therefore until it does in
3.10 release, it (export targets for Android) will not work with
certian Android devices:

Option is to try to compile master and run with the linked templates
there, or to write the client in 2 as well as 3 (3 has had other
stuttering issues before, so maybe a 2 rewrite is worthwhile).
* TODO Possibly open a web page for advanced character maintaining of skills etc.
